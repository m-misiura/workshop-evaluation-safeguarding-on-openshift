      - According to the article, Google and its parent company Alphabet were accused in a class-action lawsuit of misusing vast amount of personal information and copyrighted material. The information was taken from hundreds of millions of internet users to train its commercial AI products, which include Bard, its conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot. This case follows similar lawsuits that are filed against Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and OpenAI over their alleged misuse of personal data.

      - "A report from the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) found that autonomous vehicles are \u201Chighly vulnerable to a wide range of attacks\u201D that could be dangerous for passengers, pedestrians, and people in other vehicles. The report states that an adversarial attack might be used to make the AI 'blind' to pedestrians by manipulating the image recognition component to misclassify pedestrians. This attack could lead to havoc on the streets, as autonomous cars might hit pedestrians on the roads or crosswalks."

  descriptor: amplified
  description: AI, and large generative models in particular, might produce increased carbon emissions and increase water usage for their training and operation.
  concern: "Training and operating large AI models, building data centers, and manufacturing specialized hardware for AI can consume large amounts of water and energy, which contributes to carbon emissions. Additionally, water resources that are used for cooling AI data center servers can no longer be allocated for other necessary uses. If not managed, these could exacerbate climate change.\_"

      - "According to the source article, training earlier chatbots models such as GPT-3 led to the production of 500 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions\u2014equivalent to about 1 million miles driven by a conventional gasoline-powered vehicle. This same model required more than 1,200 MWh during the training phase\u2014roughly the amount of energy used in a million American homes in one hour."

  type: non-technical
  phase: null
  group: governance
  descriptor: amplified
  description: A metric selected to measure or track a risk is incorrectly selected, incompletely measuring the risk, or measuring the wrong risk for the given context.
  concern: "If the metrics do not measure the risk as intended, then the understanding of that risk will be incorrect and mitigations might not be applied. If the model\u2019s output is consequential, this might result in societal, reputational, or financial harm."

  title: Over- or Under-reliance
  type: output
  phase: null
  group: value alignment
  descriptor: amplified
  description: "In AI-assisted decision-making tasks, reliance measures how much a person trusts (and potentially acts on) a model\u2019s output. Over-reliance occurs when a person puts too much trust in a model, accepting a model\u2019s output when the model\u2019s output is likely incorrect. Under-reliance is the opposite, where the person doesn\u2019t trust the model but should."
  concern: In tasks where humans make choices based on AI-based suggestions, over/under reliance can lead to poor decision making because of the misplaced trust in the AI system, with negative consequences that increase with the importance of the decision.

  title: Membership inference attack
  type: input
  phase: inference
  group: privacy
  descriptor: amplified
  description: "A membership inference attack repeatedly queries a model to determine whether a given input was part of the model\u2019s training. More specifically, given a trained model and a data sample, an attacker samples the input space, observing outputs to deduce whether that sample was part of the model's training. "
  concern: Identifying whether a data sample was used for training data can reveal what data was used to train a model. Possibly giving competitors insight into how a model was trained and the opportunity to replicate the model or tamper with it. Models that include publicly-available data are at higher risk of such attacks.

  concern: If not properly developed to secure confidential data, the model might reveal confidential information or IP in the generated output. Additionally, end users' confidential information might be unintentionally collected and stored.

      - "According to the source article, employees of Samsung disclosed confidential information to OpenAI through their use of ChatGPT. In one instance, an employee pasted confidential source code to check for errors. In another, an employee shared code with ChatGPT and \u201Crequested code optimization\u201D. A third shared a recording of a meeting to convert into notes for a presentation. Samsung has limited internal ChatGPT usage in response to these incidents, but it is unlikely that they are  able to recall any of their data. Additionally, the article highlighted that in response to the risk of leaking confidential information and other sensitive information, companies like Apple, JPMorgan Chase. Deutsche Bank, Verizon, Walmart, Samsung, Amazon, and Accenture placed several restrictions on the usage of ChatGPT."
